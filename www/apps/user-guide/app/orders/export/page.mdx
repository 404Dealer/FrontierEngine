In this guide, you’ll learn how to export all orders in your Medusa store.

<Note>

Order exports are available from [Medusa v2.12.3](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.12.3). If you don't see the button to export orders in your Medusa Admin, request your technical team to [upgrade your Medusa application](!docs!/learn/update).

</Note>

## Export Orders as CSV

When you export your orders, you download a CSV with the orders' details. This is useful to import into external systems, or for creating backups.

## Export Orders

To export orders:

1. Go to the Orders page.
2. If you want to export a subset of orders matching filters, apply the filters first to the orders list.
3. Click on the Export button in the main section's header.
4. In the side window that opens, you can see any filters you've applied.
5. Click on the Export button to start the export.
6. To check the export's status, click the <InlineIcon Icon={BellAlert} alt="bell" /> notifications icon in the page's header. You should see your new export loading.
7. Once the export is ready, click the <InlineIcon Icon={ArrowDownTray} alt="download" /> icon.

<Note>

If you face any errors or difficulties, please contact your technical support team as this could be an issue in the [storage integration](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/file) used.
